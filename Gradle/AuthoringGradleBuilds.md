### [Build Phases](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_lifecycle.html)
A Gradle build has three distinct phases, which it runst in order.
1. **initialization** : Detects the `settings file`, evaluates the file
to determine which projects are included in the build, and creates a `Project`
instance for every project.
2. **configuration** : Evaluates the build scripts of every project
and included builds participate in the build, and creates a task graph
for requested tasks.
3. **execution** : Executes each of the selected tasks in order of their 
dependencies.

To put it simply: 
- Initialization searches and reads the `settings.gradle` for 
dependencies required for the build and creates `Project` instances,
for each project.
- Configuration, loads the tasks and properties to the projects 
generated by the initialization phase. At the end it has an execution 
graph.
- Execuiton executes the task graph (executes the tasks).
```kotlin
//settings.gradle.kts
rootProject.name = "demo"
// This is executed because initialization reads all the file.
println("This will be executed at init")
//----------------------------------------
//build.gradle
// This is executed because configuration reads all the file. 
println("This is executed during the configuration phase.")


tasks.register("test") {
    doLast {
        println("This is executed during the execution phase.")
    }
}

tasks.register("testBoth") {
    doFirst {
        println("This is executed first during the execution phase.")
    }
    doLast {
        println("This is executed last during the execution phase.")
    }
    // This is executed during configuration because task is loaded to graph.
    println("This is executed during the configuration phase as well, because :testBoth is used in the build.")
}
```

#### Searching for settings.gradle
You can run Gradle commands from any subdirectory of the build. When you do so 
Gradle recusively searches parent directories to locate `settings.gradle`. If the 
current directory is part of the build. The recursive search only works 
if the Gradle project layour matches the physical subproject layout on disk.

#### [Reacting to Build Lifecycle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_lifecycle.html#react_to_project_evaluation)
You can react to project evaluation using `gradle.beforeProject` and 
`gradle.afterProject`, the first later runs before the project is evaluated
and the later runs after the project is evaluated.
```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
gradle.beforeProject{...}
gradle.afterProject{...}
```
