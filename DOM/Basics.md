### What is the DOM
The DOM, is a tree structure that represents an HTML document. The main components
of the DOM are Elements and Nodes.  

- Everything in within the document is a Node. 
- Attributes are Nodes associated with an Element.
- Elements are the documents structural and functional components - all the `<...>`

> In simple terms, the window object represents something like the browser, and the document object is the root of the document itself. Element inherits from the generic Node interface, and together these two interfaces provide many of the methods and properties you use on individual elements. These elements may also have specific interfaces for dealing with the kind of data those elements hold, as in the table object example in the previous section.
