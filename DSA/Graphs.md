### Introduction to graphs
A graph is a collection of vertices and edges `G = <V, E>`.
- A vertex can be thought as a node.
- An edge is the connection that exists between two nodes. Often represented as a
tuple (if directed) or a set (if undirected) of two vertices.

The edges of a graph can be either directed or undirected:
- **Directed** means the edges have a direction, meaning `(A, B)` is different form `(B,A)`. Where
edges are read as `(start vertex, end vertex)`.
- **Undirected** means the edges are bidirectional, meaning the edge `{A,B}` is equal to `(A, B)` and `(B, A)`.

**Adjacency** is a vertex property. Two vertices `A and B` are adjacent if there exits an edge that connects `{A, B}`. Again, for 
an undirected graph `is_adj(A, B) == is_adj(B, A)`.

**Degree** is a vertex property. The in or out degree of a vertex is the number of incoming, or out going edges from a node. Again, for 
an undirected graph `out_deg(A) == in_deg(A)`.

##### More terminology:
- A **walk** is a sequence of nodes connected by edges. For example if `vi` represents a generic vertex, then `v1v2v3`
represents a walk containing 3 vertex as 2 edges: the edges are `(v1, v2)` and `(v2, v3)`. A common mistake is over counting
the length of the walk by 1.
- For edges:
    - A **trail** is a **walk** with no repeated edges. 
    - A **circuit** is a **trail** starting and ending at the same vertex. 
- For vertices:
    - A **path** is a **walk** with no repeated vertices.
    - A **cycle** is a **path** starting and ending at the same vertex.

##### Extras:
- Euler's Path is a path that visits all vertices exactly once. 
- Euler's Circuit is a circuit that visits all edges exactly once. Look up "The Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg".

##### Important types of graphs:
- A graph is **connected** if there exists a walk from `A to B` for all `A` and for all `B`.
- A graph is **complete** if it contains all possible edges excluding loops. `E = {Vi x Vj}, if i != j`.
- A graph is **simple** if it contains no self loops and repeated edges.

Now given our graph is simple one might as what is the relation between the edges `E` and vertices `V`?

If our simple undirected graph is the densest it could be it would be a complete graph. All nodes in a complete graph
have `(v - 1)` edges. Therefore the total number of edges would be:
- `|E| = v(v - 1)/2`, if undirected.
- `|E| = v(v - 1)`, if directed.

Another way to arrive at the same result is:
1. If our graph is complete, it contains all possible edges.
2. An edge is a set, if undirected, of two vertices.
3. (|v| choose 2) produces all ways to choose two vertices, and therefore all edges. Again, if directed multiply by 2.

Therefore we can conclude that any simple undirected graph is upper bounded by `2|E| <= v^2-v`.

### Representations of graphs
- **Edge List**: A list of all the edges in a graph. 
    - Space `O(e)`: Stores all edges in a list.
    - `get_adj(v)` `O(e)`: Scans list and returns all edges containing v.
    - `is_edge(x, y)` `O(e)`: Scans list and checks whether `{x, y}` exists.
- **Adjacency List**: A hash table of vertices to lists of their adjacent vertices.
    - Space `O(v*max(deg(v)))`: Allocates a hash table of size `v` pointing to lists of size `deg(v)`.
    - `get_adj(v)` `O(1)`: Returns list at slot `v`.
    - `is_edge(x, y)` `O(deg(x))`: Scans list of slot `v` and checks whether `y` is in the list.
- **Adjacency Matrix** A `v*v` boolean matrix containing a `1` if edge `AdjMat[x][y]` exists.
    - Space `O(v^2)`: Allocates a `v*v` array.
    - `get_adj(v)` `O(v)`: Scans row `AdjMax[v][:]` and returns all `y` if `AdjMax[v][y] == 1`.
    - `is_edge(x, y)` `O(1)`: returns `AdjMax[x][y]`.

Each of the representations has its drawbacks and advantages. Selection depends on several factors:
- Is the graph sparse or dense?
- What operation will we perform more frequently? Checking for edges or requesting adjacent vertices? 

### Computations on Graphs
Some of the common computations performed in graphs are:
- **Connectivity**: Is there a walk from vertex `A` to `B`?
- **Shortest Path**: What is the shortest path from `A` to `B`?
- **Single Source Shortest Path**: What is the shortest path from vertex `A` to all vertices?

The beauty is that by computing the **single source shortest path**, *sssp from now on*, of `A` we have the answer of connectivity, and shortest
path for all nodes with respect to `A`. Here is how:
- *sssp* will perform a level order traversal of the graph and return a `dict<key = vertex, value = tuple<dist, prev>>`.
```
q = [x0]
dict[x0] = (0, None)

while q is not empty:
    v = q.deque()
    for u in adj(v):
        if u not in dict:
            dict[u] = (dict[v].dist + 1, v)
            q.enqueue(u)

return dict
```
Now what is the time complexity of this? Well we do iterate over all edges, and we allocate space in the order of the number of vertices.
Therefore the time complexity for the algorithm above is `O(|v| + |e|)`.
> Note |e| could be of order `O(n^2)` since |e| <= |v|^2 - |v|.

From the return type of *sssp* to check for connectedness we check whether the vertex `v` is in the `dict`.
To reconstruct the shortest path form `v` to `source`, we query `dict[v.prev]` recursively until we arrive at `source`.
